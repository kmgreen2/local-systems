# local-systems
Repo for setting up distributed systems locally.  At this point, this is mostly
just notes on minikube.

This repo used to contain manifests and scripts for running Kafka, ZK and
Ethereum in Kubernetes.  The system-specific manifests, scripts, etc. is now
being maintained here: https://github.com/kmgreen2/cloud-deployments
